## About My Project
The web-based product and discount tracker is a standalone system designed to connect customers and merchants for deal transactions. Customers can set a budget, browse, search, and compare deals offered by registered merchants, while merchants can create, manage, and track their deals, process orders, and communicate with customers. The platform includes administrative functionalities for user management, deal moderation, support, and analytics. It integrates with secure external payment gateways for payment processing, ensures performance optimization, implements security measures, enhances usability, and ensures reliability and scalability. The system is compatible with various web browsers, operating systems, and devices.
