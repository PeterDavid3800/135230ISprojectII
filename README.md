This is my information systems project for submission at the end of the academic year. It is about a product and discount tracker that revolutionizes student finances with a comprehensive tracker. Centralized for exclusive discounts, it goes beyond, aiding expense tracking, budget setting, and personalized recommendations. Empowering informed decisions, it's a holistic solution for financial success.
